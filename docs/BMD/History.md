You might have figured out last night that there were 2 updates pushed out, here's what they were:

## **Upcoming Release** - Sep 14, 23
### Studio Bot Maker's Release!
It's almost out of the oven - coming out September 2023!

It's been a month since Studio Bot Maker v3 got discontinued, but does that mean it's not going to come back better and stronger?
If you said no, you're wrong! And worry not, V4 is even more feature rich and even simpler to navigate!

Let's glance over the elephants in the room - the amazing features of Studio Bot Maker!

#1 - The brand new actions!
Whilst v3 had 69 actions (nice üòè) - v4 has bumped up that number to 77! And that doesn't mean it got just 7 more actions, nono! It merged reply to interaction and send message in one action, it got completely rid of useless actions, it got jumping to certain actions and skipping actions, and not only, it got a complete overhaul of all the actions!

#2 - Skipping & Jumping to Actions
You read the title right, you can skip and jump to actions! Here's how that one works:

Alright, you've seen the action, now how about you see what it does!
Oh, did I mention you're not limited to just jumping, skipping, and continuing your actions? You can also ‚ú® end ‚ú® them!

#4 - Global, Server, and Temporary Variables!
Yep, after lacking them for a while now, every action has support for global variables - both storing & getting them!

#5 - The new & improved action previews!
You might have found them lacking or vague in previous versions - but not this time! They've been re-thought out! I won't spoil anything this time, you'll figure out what I meant!

#6 - Consistency across actions!
Some v3 actions might have felt new, modern, good, and great! But, others could have felt unpolished and odd. Well, worry not! After the huge action redo, everything's been made to fit in with it's surroundings!
